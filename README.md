## Hi there 👋
### Austin here!

- Pronouns: he / him
- Country: Canada 🍁🍁🍁

I'm currently a beginner to the world of GitHub. I hope to learn enough so that one day I can contribute to large projects. I'm interested
in engineering. I was part of an FTC team for a while before I left due to cost issues, I'm looking to join my school team this fall. I'm 
also learning about microchips and motors (arduino). 

My main goal at the moment is learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I can create my own website. You can see my progress here:
